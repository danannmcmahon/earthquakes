# Demo application allowing search of historical earthquake data from earthquake.usgs.gov.

# A selection of search parameters are available to the user, with external links to earthquake.usgs.gov providing detailed information for each record.

# The Application is built with React and Bootstrap.

# This is one of my first React projects and provided a excellent learning experience.  It also allowed me to     familiarize with Fluent/Fabric UI although not used in the final draft.  My first draft of this project was written in JavaScript.
